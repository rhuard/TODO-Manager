# Brain Dump
Don't have time to plan this now so here is ideas:

* Can have multiple too do lists
* locations (eg workspaces)
* due dates (not priority)
* tags (Blocked, any other arbitrary tags)
* sort by tags/location
* both cli/qt frontend?
* SUBTAKS -> MAJOR IMPORTANCE
** can expand task into subtasks
** check off inidividual subtasks
* Prority queue/way to protirize manually and sort by priority
* Probably save as json or something like that.. pickle maybe
* reminders (low prioirty)
* link between tasks? (low priority -> if require linking subtasks should be sufficent for most)
* details? can add details or links to websites or something...? (low priority)
